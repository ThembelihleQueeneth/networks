A Wi-Fi USB dongle, also known as a wireless USB adapter,
is a small device that plugs into a computer's USB port to enable wireless internet access,
especially for devices lacking built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. It acts as a receiver and transmitter
for Wi-Fi signals, allowing you to connect to wireless networks and browse the internet,
stream videos, or send emails.
