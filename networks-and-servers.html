            <p>In computer networking, a server is a powerful computer that provides resources and services to other computers (clients) over a network.</p>

            <h2>Wi-Fi vs Ethernet</h2>
            <p>Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections are the two main ways businesses can gain internet access. But what is the difference between WiFi and ethernet? WiFi, an abbreviation for wireless fidelity, uses radio waves to facilitate high-speed internet without cables and relies on a wireless adapter that creates hotspots using small antennas. Multiple electrical devices can connect to a single Wi-Fi network.

                Ethernet uses a Local Area Network (LAN) and was first standardized in the 1980s. With Ethernet, an internet cable must physically connect to each device to transfer data. Your internet service provider most likely offers both Wi-Fi and Ethernet.</p> <br>
                <p>Generally, Ethernet offers faster and more stable connections, making it ideal for tasks like online gaming and streaming, while Wi-Fi provides convenience and mobility.
                    In fact, if you compare a 100 Mbps Ethernet connection to a 300 Mbps Wi-Fi connection, the Ethernet will still often produce faster effective data rates. The reason for this is stability. Wi-Fi has to project signals out into the air with no idea where the connected devices are actually located. </p>

            <h2>Wi-Fi USB dongle</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/usb_wifi_adapter.webp" alt="">
            <p>
                     A Wi-Fi USB dongle, also known as a wireless USB adapter,
                    is a small device that plugs into a computer's USB port to enable wireless internet access,
                    especially for devices lacking built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. It acts as a receiver and transmitter
                    for Wi-Fi signals, allowing you to connect to wireless networks and browse the internet,
                    stream videos, or send emails. 
  
            </p>
            <p>
                Wi-Fi dongles are particularly useful for older devices that lack built-in Wi-Fi capabilities or have outdated wireless adapters. They act as a USB adapter, allowing these devices to connect to Wi-Fi networks and access the internet wirelessly.

        <h2>Server network</h2>
        <p>A server network refers to the infrastructure that connects servers and clients, enabling them to share resources and communicate with each other. This network typically involves a central server that manages resources and provides services to connected clients, such as computers, smartphones, and other devices. Server networks are crucial for various functions, including data storage, application access, and network management. </p>
        <h3>Key Components and functions of a server network</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Servers:</strong>These are specialized computers that provide services and resources to other devices (clients). Examples include web servers, file servers, application servers, and database servers. </li>
            <li><strong>Clients:</strong>These are the devices (computers, phones, etc.) that connect to the server network to access resources and services. </li>
            <li><strong>Network infrastructure:</strong>This includes the physical and logical components that enable communication between clients and servers, such as routers, switches, and network cables. </li>
            <li><strong>Protocols:</strong>These are the rules and standards that govern communication between clients and servers, like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. </li>
            <li><strong>Operating systems:</strong>These provide the underlying software platform for both clients and servers. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Secure collaboration across the internet</h2>
        <p>Secure collaboration across the internet involves using tools and practices that protect sensitive information during online teamwork</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Secure file sharing and exchange:</strong>Allowing employees and team members to share information that is pertinent to a project without compromising intellectual property or proprietary information. Hence, you have the confidence to share files without fear of their contents being seen by prying eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Productivity and communication:</strong>Emailing back and forth can be cumbersome. Collaboration tools save time and resources — no need to gather people inside a physical conference room — by serving as a virtual meeting room.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong>It facilitates quick communication across geographic locations, allowing participants to seek feedback and respond promptly with tasks actioned immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization:</strong>Secure collaboration tools allow you to track the progress of tasks and files.</li>
        </ol>
